# OpenShift CLI (oc) Login and Runner

Action for running oc commands. Intended for use with the BC Government's OpenShift cluster.  We will do our best to keep the default oc runner version lined up with whatever the platform team currently has deployed to production.

Provide as few as zero commands to login only.  There is a separate parameter for cronjobs, with the ability to report success or failure.

# Usage

```yaml
- uses: bcgov/actions-openshift/oc-runner@v0.1.0
  with:
    ### Required
    
    # OpenShift project/namespace
    oc_namespace: abc123-dev

    # OpenShift server
    oc_server: https://api.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca:6443
    
    # OpenShift token
    # Usually available as a secret in your project/namespace
    oc_token: ${{ secrets.OC_TOKEN }}


    ### Typical / recommended

    # Command to run, generally oc commands
    commands: oc whoami

    # Cronjob to run and report on
    cronjob: repo-name-cronjob-etc

    # Bash array to diff for triggering; omit to always run
    triggers: ('frontend/' 'backend/' 'database/')


    ### Usually a bad idea / not recommended

    # Number of cronjob log lines to tail; use -1 for all
    cronjob_tail: 0

    # Overrides the default branch to diff against
    diff_branch: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}

    # Override GitHub default oc version >= 4.0
    oc_version: "4.14"

    # Override repository to clone
    repository: ${{ github.repository }}

    # Override branch, tag or SHA to clone; omit to use the default branch
    ref: ''

    # Timeout for command or cronjob; e.g. 10m
    timeout: 10m

    # Enable verbose command tracing with bash xtrace (set -x)
    verbose: false

    # Maximum number of connection retry attempts for logging into OpenShift
    login_attempts: 5
```

# Example: Login only

Login only.

```yaml
login:
  name: Login Only
  runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
  steps:
    - uses: bcgov/actions-openshift/oc-runner@v0.1.0
      with:
        oc_namespace: ${{ vars.oc_namespace }}
        oc_server: ${{ vars.oc_server }}
        oc_token: ${{ secrets.OC_TOKEN }}
```

# Example: Run Multiple Commands Conditionally (w/ Triggers)

Run multiple commands if any trigger files/paths have changes.  Triggers are optional.

```yaml
whoareyou:
  name: Who Are You?
  runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
  steps:
    - uses: bcgov/actions-openshift/oc-runner@v0.1.0
      with:
        oc_namespace: ${{ vars.oc_namespace }}
        oc_server: ${{ vars.oc_server }}
        oc_token: ${{ secrets.OC_TOKEN }}
        triggers: ('frontend/' 'backend/' 'database/')
        commands: |
          oc whoami
          oc version
```

# Example: Run and Report on Cronjob (w/ Triggers)

Provide the name of a cronjob object.  It will be run timestamped and return a success or failure on completion.  Triggers are optional.

```yaml
cronjob:
  name: Run and Report on Cronjob
  runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
  steps:
    - uses: bcgov/actions-openshift/oc-runner@v0.1.0
      with:
        oc_namespace: ${{ vars.oc_namespace }}
        oc_server: ${{ vars.oc_server }}
        oc_token: ${{ secrets.OC_TOKEN }}
        triggers: ('cronjobland/' 'misc/' 'whatever/')
        cronjob: repo-name-cronjob-etc
```

# Output

This action returns:

- `triggered`: boolean (`'true'` or `'false'`) indicating whether trigger paths changed
- `commands`: generic command output channel from the `commands` step (usually empty unless explicitly set)

`commands` is expected to be empty in most runs. To populate it, write to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` inside your `commands` input. Plain text lines are automatically mapped to the `commands` output (you do not need to prefix with `commands=`). Existing `commands=<value>` usage is still supported.

```yaml
jobs:
  command:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      triggered: ${{ steps.oc.outputs.triggered }}
      commands: ${{ steps.oc.outputs.commands }}
    steps:
      - id: oc
        uses: bcgov/actions-openshift/oc-runner@v0.1.0
        with:
          oc_namespace: ${{ vars.oc_namespace }}
          oc_server: ${{ vars.oc_server }}
          oc_token: ${{ secrets.OC_TOKEN }}
          commands: |
            oc whoami
            echo "$(oc whoami)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

  result:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [command]
    steps:
      - run: |
          echo "Triggered = ${{ needs.command.outputs.triggered }}"
          echo "Command output = ${{ needs.command.outputs.commands }}"
```

# OpenShift Login Retry and Fail-Fast Behavior

To handle transient network drops, cluster API restarts, or runner configuration mistakes, the action implements validation gates and retry logic:
- **Early Input Validation:** Before executing any login attempts or downloading tools, the action validates that `oc_server`, `oc_namespace`, and `oc_token` are populated and that the server URL is properly formatted. If inputs are missing or malformed, the action fails fast immediately to prevent useless retries.
- **Fail Fast:** If the OpenShift API returns a non-retryable client error (such as `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, or `404 Not Found`), the action aborts immediately on the first attempt to save runner billing minutes.
- **Retry:** If the connection times out at the network layer (HTTP status `000`), hits a request timeout (`408`), gets rate-limited (`429`), or if the API returns a transient server error (HTTP status `5xx` during control-plane reboots), the action sleeps with exponential backoff (starting at 2 seconds) and retries up to `login_attempts` times.
- **CLI Download Timeout:** Download of the `oc` CLI client archive from `mirror.openshift.com` is capped with a 15-second timeout and 3 retry attempts to prevent workflows from hanging indefinitely.

# Troubleshooting

The `commands` block runs in strict shell mode. A command failure (including optional `grep` misses in pipelines) can stop the step immediately.

- For optional matches, use guards like `grep ... || true`
- Prefer explicit conditional checks when an empty result is valid
- Set `verbose: true` to enable `set -x` tracing for the `commands` block and internal output processing; enable it temporarily and only when you are confident sensitive values will not be printed

## Safe Debugging

When `verbose: true` is enabled, shell tracing may show expanded command arguments, environment usage, and command output in logs. GitHub masks known secrets, but derived or partial secret values can still leak. Use this mode only for short-lived troubleshooting and avoid commands that print or interpolate sensitive values.
